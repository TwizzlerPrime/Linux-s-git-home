      What is a bash script?          
Bash script is a file that contains a series of commands executed by the Bash shell, commonly used in Unix/Linux 
systems. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command-line interpreter.
                     How to Write a bash script.
1. Always start with a shebang (#!) to specify the shell interpreter. (e.g #!/bin/bash)

2.Variables are declared without "$", but is referred to using the "$" symbol. 
No spaces between the variable and its value are allowed to be made. E.g =
#!/bin/bash
NAME="Ire"
echo "Hello. $NAME"
3. "if-else" statements: they check conditions and execute code based on whether the condition is true or false.
For example, it can check wheter a file  exists or not when combined with -d.
  chmod is used in making your bash scripts executable.

                                            System Monitoring
    System monitoring is the tracking, and analysis of the performance, health, activity and security of computers.
It collects many data aspects such as CPU usage, memory use, network traffic, disk space, and app performance.
It also tracks malware activity, unauthorized access attempts, and any other security related issues.

    We can use shell and bash scripts (on linux) to monitor system resources like CPU, memory, etc.
#!/bin/bash
# CPU, Memory, Disk Usage Monitoring Script

echo "CPU Usage:"
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)"

echo "Memory Usage:"
free -m

echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h
